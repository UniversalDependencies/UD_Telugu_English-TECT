# Summary

UD Telugu_English-TECT is a Telugu-English code-switching treebank. 

# Introduction

The treebank consists of edited data from the Telugu UD treebank (Rama and Vajilla, 2021), sentences from a grammar book, and the MASSIVE dataset, spoken conversational utterances in Telugu (FitzGerald et al., 2022; Bastianelli et al., 2020). The sentences were randomly selected from each corpus. The sentences were romanized and each sentence was altered to contain at least one code-switch. The sentences were then annotated following the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme. 

# Data Split

In total, there are 98 sentences. The data is split into 62 sentences for train and 36 sentences for test. 

# Language IDs

The following language Ids are stored in the MISC column:

- "te": Telugu
- "en": English
- "univ": Punctuation, symbols, numbers, etc. 

# Acknowledgments

 We want to thank the creators of the Telugu UD treebank and MASSIVE dataset for their corpus.

    abstract = "Spoken Language Understanding infers semantic meaning directly from audio data, and thus promises to reduce error propagation and misunderstandings in end-user applications. However, publicly available SLU resources are limited. In this paper, we release SLURP, a new SLU package containing the following: (1) A new challenging dataset in English spanning 18 domains, which is substantially bigger and linguistically more diverse than existing datasets; (2) Competitive baselines based on state-of-the-art NLU and ASR systems; (3) A new transparent metric for entity labelling which enables a detailed error analysis for identifying potential areas of improvement. SLURP is available at https://github.com/pswietojanski/slurp."
